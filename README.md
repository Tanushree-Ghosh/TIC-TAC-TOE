# TIC-TAC-TOE
I had build a two-player tic-tac-toe game, which we can play in the command-line. Initially, I have made an empty game board 
and then It will take inputs from the players and It will check for the winning condition and if the whole board gets filled and no one wins, 
It will declare the result as “Tie” and ask users if they want to restart the game.
